# pi.exe
A cursed app starring a certain farting lizard.

The main attraction of this repository is the MP4 file titled with yesterday's date.  It tells a story where the cursed app appears on my desktop uninvited, and after summoning the courage, I start recording with OBS and run pi.exe.

Inspired by old screen savers with characters running around the desktop, I made an app where a polite pogona appears and patiently waits to be clicked on.

And then he farts.

Including two (2) meme farts.
